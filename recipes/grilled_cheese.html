    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious grilled cheese that probably wasn't really made on a grill. They're kind of a huge scam that way</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat non-stick pan to medium temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut enough cheese to cover bread all the way to all four corners.</li>
        <li>Butter one side of two pieces of bread.</li>
        <li>Put one piece of bread butter side down onto hot pan, add cheese, top with 
            remaining piece of bread buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly golden brown and flip to uncooked side. Flip frequently
             after lightly golden until all cheese is melted.</li>
    </ol>
